We have a new preprint out, where we study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the thermal Tonks-Girardeau gas, also known as strongly repulsive Lieb-Liniger model.

# Abstract

We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas at thermal equilibrium. Recently, such excitations were investigated for the ground state of the system, and discovered that they prevail for evaluating the one-body correlation function of the model. Here we extend it for finite temperatures. 

Check it out [arxiv:2410.20929](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20929).

Enjoy!
