### CIQS: Correlation aspects of Interacting Quantum Systems in reduced dimensionality

I am happy to share that I have been awarded the  <a href="https://polonezbis.eu/en/">Polonez Bis</a> project CIQS - Correlation aspects of Interacting Quantum Systems in reduced dimensionality, co-funded by the National Science Centre and the European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant.
In this project we will investigate correlation properties of one-dimensional interacting quantum systems within the Bethe ansatz framework.

For additional details, please see our <a href="https://ftahas.github.io/projects/ciqs/">project page</a>.

Stay tuned!
