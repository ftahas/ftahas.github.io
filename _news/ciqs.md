### CIQS: Correlation aspects of Interacting Quantum Systems in reduced dimensionality

I am happy to share that I have been awarded awarded the  <a href="https://polonezbis.eu/en/">Polonez Bis</a> project CIQS - Correlation aspects of Interacting Quantum Systems in reduced dimensionality, co-funded by the European Commission and the Polish National Science Centre under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant. 
In this project we will investigate correlation properties of one-dimensional interacting quantum systems within the framework of Bethe ansatz. 

For additional details, please see our <a href="https://ftahas.github.io/projects/ciqs/">project page</a>.

Stay tuned!
