### CIQS: Correlation aspects of Interacting Quantum Systems in reduced dimensionality

Together with Piotr Deuar from the Institute of Physics PAS, we have been awarded the Polonez Bis 1 project on Correlation aspects of Interacting Quantum Systems in reduced dimensionality. 
In this project we aim at investigating correlations of integrable quantum field theories in 1d within the framework of Bethe ansatz. 

For additional details, please see /projects. 

Stay tuned!
