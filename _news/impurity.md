I am pleased to share that we have a new paper out entitled "Mobile impurity in a one-dimensional gas at finite temperatures".   

# Abstract

We consider the McGuire model of a one-dimensional gas of free fermions interacting with a single impurity. We compute the static one-body function and momentum distribution of the impurity at finite temperatures. The results involve averages over Fredholm determinants that we further analyse using the effective form factors approach. With this approach, we derive the large-distance behaviour of the one-body function, which takes the form of an averaged exponential decay. This method allows us to study an experimentally important regime of small momenta of the impurity's momentum distribution. We also consider the one-body function at short distances and compute finite temperature Tan's contact.

You can find it here [arXiv:2202.07657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07657).

Cheers!
