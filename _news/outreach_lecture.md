I am happy to share that today we have visited the prestigious Montessori High School in Warsaw, where we conducted a lecture on "The fascinating realm of Quantum Mechanics and its implications" 
as part of outreach activives within the Polonez Bis 1 project CIQS. [Lecture here](./../assets/pdf/QM_lecture.pdf)

## Abstract

    Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that explores the
    behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, the
    subatomic world. Since its dawn in the early 20th century, it has
    both intrigued scientists and revolutionized our understanding of
    the universe. In this lecture, we will delve into the fascinating
    principles of quantum mechanics, from the counterintuitive
    phenomena of superposition and entanglement to the probabilistic
    nature of particle behavior. We will then explore how these
    principles are being harnessed in cutting-edge technologies, with
    a particular focus on quantum computing. Unlike classical
    computers, which process information in binary bits, quantum
    computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple
    states simultaneously, offering unprecedented computational power.
