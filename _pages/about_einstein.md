Hello World! Welcome to my personal website. I am a physicist with a theoretical background on interacting quantum systems, integrable models in quantum field theories, mathematical physics, and complex systems in general.
I invite you to check out my [publications](https://ftahas.github.io/publications) and [projects](https://ftahas.github.io/projects) for more details.
Currently I am a Polonez Bis fellow working on correlation aspects of interacting quantum systems in one dimension at the Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw.

Also, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ftahas) where I make available repos on my work and other personal projects.
