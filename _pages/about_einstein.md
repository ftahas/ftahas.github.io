I am a physicist with a theoretical background on interacting quantum systems, integrable models in quantum field theories, mathematical physics, and AMO physics in general. 
I posses a large set of interests, ranging from foundations of quantum mechanics and its applications to quantum technologies,, 

Currently I am a Polonez Bis fellow working on correlation aspects of interacting quantum systems in one dimension at the Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw.
