Hello World! Welcome to my personal website. I am a physicist with a theoretical background on interacting quantum systems, integrable models in quantum field theories, mathematical physics, and AMO physics in general.
I posses a large set of interests, ranging from foundations of quantum mechanics and its applications to quantum technologies,,

Currently I am a Polonez Bis fellow working on correlation aspects of interacting quantum systems in one dimension at the Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw.

Also, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ftahas) where I make available repos on my work and other personal projects.
