For $$ \mathrm{Re}(z)>1 $$, the Riemann zeta function is defined as 

\begin{equation}
\zeta(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{-z}}.
\end{equation}


The Riemann zeta function is connected to prime numbers through the Euler product representation: 
\begin{equation}
\zeta(z) = \prod_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{1-p^{-z}}, \quad \mathbb{P} = \{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,\dots \}
\end{equation}
$$ \mathbb{P} $$ is the set of prime numbers.
